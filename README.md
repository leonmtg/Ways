## What's Ways?
Thare are so many ways to learn a language. And you might once ask someone the question "What's the best way to learn a language?" Some even claim to have found "the secret" to learning languages or the "best method". Unfortunately, learning languages is naturally a long-term thing. So you probably find the "best method" inefficient or useless after sticking with it for three months.

Ways clarifies how should you learn a language. To be honest, Ways doesn't try to help you find the "best method". We try to help you find the "most suitable" way.
